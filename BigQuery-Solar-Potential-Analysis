Project Title: Solar Potential Analysis in BigQuery
Overview:
This project analyzes the solar potential of different regions using the bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code dataset in BigQuery. 
The goal is to identify areas with high solar potential and provide insights for potential solar energy projects.
Methodology:
Data Extraction: Extracted relevant data from the BigQuery dataset, including postal_code, average_solar_potential, total_area, and other relevant columns.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of solar potential and identify any outliers or anomalies.
Correlation Analysis: Calculated the correlation between average_solar_potential and total_area to assess their relationship.
SQL Code used for Exploratory Analysis:
-- SELECT state_name, AVG(yearly_sunlight_kwh_kw_threshold_avg) AS average_sun
-- FROM 'bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code'
-- GROUP BY state_name
-- ORDER BY average_sun DESC
-- LIMIT 3
SQL Code used for Regression Analysis:
-- WITH solar_data AS (
--   SELECT
--     postal_code,
--     average_solar_potential,
--     total_area
--   FROM
--     `bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code`
-- )
-- 
-- SELECT
--   CORR(average_solar_potential, total_area) AS correlation_coefficient
-- FROM
--   solar_data;
SELECT
  CORR(yearly_sunlight_kwh_total, count_qualified) AS correlation_coefficient
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code`;

Key Findings:
The correlation coefficient of 0.889223828741 indicates a strong positive correlation between average_solar_potential and total_area. This suggests that regions with larger areas tend to have higher average solar potential.
Top States by Average Sunlight:
The second query identifies the top three states with the highest average sunlight based on yearly_sunlight_kwh_kw_threshold_avg:
New Mexico: 1416.69 kWh/kW
Arizona: 1371.32 kWh/kW
Nevada: 1363.57 kWh/kW
 
Area and Solar Potential: Regions with larger total areas generally have higher solar potential.
Sun-Drenched States: New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada consistently rank high in terms of average sunlight, making them ideal locations for solar energy projects.

The SQL code used for data extraction, analysis, and visualization is available in the solar_potential_analysis.sql file.
Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into the solar potential of different regions.
The findings can be used to inform decision-making for solar energy projects and investments.
