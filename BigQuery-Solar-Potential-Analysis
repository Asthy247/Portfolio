**Project Title: Solar Potential Analysis in BigQuery

**Overview:**

This project analyzes the solar potential of different regions using the `bigquery-public-data.sunroof_solar.solar_potential_by_postal_code` dataset in BigQuery. The goal is to identify areas with high solar potential and provide insights for potential solar energy projects.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Extraction:** Extracted relevant data from the BigQuery dataset, including `postal_code`, `average_solar_potential`, `total_area`, and other relevant columns.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of solar potential and identify any outliers or anomalies.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Calculated the correlation between `average_solar_potential` and `total_area` to assess their relationship.
5. **Visualization:** Created choropleth maps to visualize the spatial distribution of solar potential across different regions.

**Key Findings:**

* [Summarize your key findings here, such as the regions with highest solar potential, correlations between variables, and any other insights you discovered.]

**Code:**

* The SQL code used for data extraction, analysis, and visualization is available in the `solar_potential_analysis.sql` file.

**Additional Resources:**
